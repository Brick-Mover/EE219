## Project 5: Popularity Prediction on Twitter
- knowing current (and previous) tweet activity for a hashtag, can we predict its tweet activity in the future?
- The available Twitter data is collected by querying popular hashtags related to the 2015 Super Bowl spanning a period starting from 2 weeks before the game to a week after the game.
- We will use data from some of the related hashtags to train a regression model and then use the model to make predictions for other hashtags.
